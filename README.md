# Foundation Models for Time Series: A Survey  
**Short Story Assignment**

---

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains my individual “short story” assignment—a deep survey and narrative on the paper **“Foundation Models for Time Series: A Survey”** (arXiv:2504.04011, April 2025). You’ll find:

- A **Medium.com article** Link : https://medium.com/@jayanth.kalyanam/in-recent-years-foundation-models-large-transformers-pre-trained-on-massive-diverse-corpora-2027d530b068
- A **Slide deck** on slideshare.net : https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/foundation-models-for-time-series-a-survey/278541537
- A **Youtube video** Link : https://youtu.be/V-OvA6ywY9s
- A **The Survey Paper** Link : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04011

## 🎯 Objective  
- **Summarize** state-of-the-art time series foundation models  
- **Explain** taxonomy, architectures, objectives, benchmarks, and future directions  
- **Translate** dense academic content into an engaging Medium article  
- **Support** learning with slides, video narration, and in-repo illustrations

## 📝 Problem Statement  
Traditional time-series forecasting and analysis require bespoke models for each dataset. Recent work applies the **foundation model paradigm** (pre-train once, adapt anywhere)—so far proven in NLP/CV—to sequential data. This assignment reviews and re-articulates that emerging field’s landscape.

## 👥 Target Audience  
- **Graduate students** and **early-career researchers** in ML/DS  
- **Practitioners** seeking an entry point into time-series foundation models  
- **Educators** looking for concise teaching materials on modern forecasting
